# Build a simple pipeline for transforming json data from files to table


### Step1: Create tables for storing by running script:
> "python create_tables.py"

This script Drop all exists tables and create new ones


### Step2: Run pipeline by script:
> "python etl.py"

This script load data from songs_data and log_data. Then insert these data into created tables


### file "test.ipynb" for checking whether tables and data is imported or not!
### file "etl.ipynb" for running "step 2" step by step
